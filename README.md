# Machine-Learning-Project
This repository contains files completed in conjunction with a class in machine learning from 
the Johns Hopkins University.  Inside the repository an HTML file generated by RStudio and using
an R Markdown that serve as a writeup for the project.  The R Markdown and a simple R program 
used to model sensor output and predict the outcome of exercise is also included.

the compiled HTML is in the gh-pages branch where I figured it was supposed to go.  You can 
access the HTML there or just point to:  https://jsyoungnet.github.io/Machine-Learning-Project/
