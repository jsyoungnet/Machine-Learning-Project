# Machine-Learning-Project
This repository contains files completed in conjunction with a class in machine learning from 
the Johns Hopkins University.  Inside the repository are a series of HTML files that serve as a
writeup for the project and a simple R program used to model sensor output and predict the 
outcome of exercise.
